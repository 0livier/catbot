catbot
===

_A simple framework to write simple, stateful bots._

This framework will listen to all messages delivered to any channel it's invited to.

The bot framework is triggered by a message whose first character is a "?"

When the framework hears a message like this, it treats it as a command in the following format:

```?module-name target-user arg1 arg2 ...```

The framework will attempt to load the module identified by the module-name param. If it exists,
the framework will pass the `user` and `args` as one array (user is the first element), as well as
storage objects specific to the user, specific to the module and common across all modules, to the
module's `handle` function.

Quick Start
---

Set up a [custom integration for your team](https://api.slack.com/bot-users). Get the API token for the bot, and then run:

```SLACK_API_TOKEN=[token] npm start```

You can add new modules in the `modules` directory; look at `echo.js` and `++.js` for sample code.

Things to do / errata
---

Allow modules to describe the kind of input they expect. Right now I'm assuming that the first argument is a
user (and doing things with storage with that assumption). Certain modules might not care about a user (eg ?meme)
and shouldn't get "user" storage set up.

Relatedly, currently the 'user' parameter can be any string. It _might_ be more sensible to enforce it to be a reference
to a user (eg @foo) for consistency but doing that removes some use cases, like "?endorse rain for making things wet".

Storage right now is very very na√Øve, just using the node implementation of localStorage, which maps to files.
Would be much better to use SQLite for this.

Right now the bot exposes an empty web page. I would love it if each module could return a blob of HTML describing
stats for users or other module-specific renderings, and then put those on the page. For instance, if someone
implemented a ?meme bot, it would be fun to show the last _n_ memes.
