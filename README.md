catbot
===

_A simple framework to write simple, stateful bots._

This framework will listen to all messages delivered to any channel it's invited to.

The bot framework is triggered by a message whose first character is a "?"

When the framework hears a message like this, it treats it as a command in the following format:

```?module-name user arg1 arg2 ...```

The framework will attempt to load the module identified by the module-name param. If it exists,
the framework will pass the `user` and `args` as one array (user is the first element), as well as
storage objects specific to the user, specific to the module and common across all modules, to the
module's `handle` function.

Quick Start
---

Set up a [custom integration for your team](https://api.slack.com/bot-users). Get the API token for the bot, and then run:

```SLACK_API_TOKEN=[token] npm start```

You can add new modules in the `modules` directory; look at `echo.js` and `++.js` for sample code.

Things to do / errata
---

Currently the 'user' parameter can be any string. It might be more sensible to enforce it to be a reference
to a user (eg @foo) for consistency but doing that removes some use cases, like "?endorse rain for making things wet"

Storage right now is very very na√Øve, just using the node implementation of localStorage, which maps to files.
Would be much better to use SQLite for this.
